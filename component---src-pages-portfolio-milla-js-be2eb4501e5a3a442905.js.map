The goal here was to create quick sketches to get the point across without spending too much time on the UI elements.</p>\n      <p>The biggest challenge I had when creating these sketches was making sure the interaction was clear. I made sure to use arrows and coloured dots to indicate click marks.</p>\n      <img width=\"100%\" src={wireframe} />\n      <p>The early prototypes of MILLA included a splash screen, welcome page and onboarding screens that highlighted some of the important features of the app. The user is then directed to a screen where they could choose to sign up if they had not used the app before or login if they already had an account. For first time users once they signed in they were prompted with 4 personalization questions, which adds in the engagement and relevancy of the content that is presented to the user.</p>\n      <p>The user is then brought to the list of lessons page, which is also the home screen. From here users can navigate to their profile, the explore page or the notes page. The profile page allows them to change their preferences and personalizations. The explore feature allows them to take picture of objects around them, see the translation and listen to the pronunciation of those objects. The notes feature allows the user to create and save free form notes. As for the lessons, they are based mostly around audio clips. Since users wanted more detailed explanations of grammar, the app allows for a grammar drop down when users are going through the material.</p>\n      <h1>Prototype</h1>\n      <p>From my low-fidelity wireframes, I created a mid-fidelity prototype in Marvel, so that I could have my usability testers interact with a working version of MILLA.</p>\n      <h1>Early Prototypes Iterations</h1>\n      <p>{\"At first the lessons would finish and go straight back to the lessons page. The abruptness of the change left users confused and feeling like the lesson was incomplete.

At first I just used text as I was showing a low-fidelity prototype to reduce feedback on design however, the text ended up being a problem as it was too small to read.
