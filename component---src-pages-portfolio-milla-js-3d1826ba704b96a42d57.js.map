need/want to be immersed in the language before they get to their travel destinations, so they can start preparing to have conversations.\n      </p>\n      <p>There are many ways to learn a new language. For those that are travellers or expats who are looking to learn a new language often the goal is to be able to have a conversation not to be fluent in the language. Most language learning experts agree that the top 7 things you need to do are:\n        <ol>\n          <li>Learn the right words</li>\n          <li>Hear the language continuously spoken</li>\n          <li>Speak to native speakers</li>\n          <li>Use spacial repetition and mnemonics</li>\n          <li>Embrace mistakes</li>\n          <li>Create SMART goals/motivation</li>\n          <li>Learn accents/intonation</li>\n        </ol>\n      </p>\n      <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>\n      <p>It was important to conduct a competitive analysis to understand what products are already on the market, what they are doing right, and what pain points users are experiencing still.

Personalization is also a key feature of the app as this will help the user engage with the content.</p>\n      <p>These flows were created with draw.io to make sure I understood the interaction between the users and MILLA when they attempt to complete core tasks.</p>\n      <p>\n        <b>User Flow #1</b>\n        <b>User Goal:</b> To complete a personalized lesson with complex grammar.\n        <b>Entry Point:</b> Open application.\n        <b>Success Criteria:</b> User completes lesson and understands the complex grammar when it comes up again.\n      </p>\n      <img src={userflow1} />\n      <p>\n        <b>User Flow #2</b>\n        <b>User Goal:</b> To add an item to Library and Lessons.\n        <b>Entry Point:</b> Menu.\n        <b>Success Criteria:</b> Item captured (image, or phrase) is added to the library and to lessons for user to review in upcoming lessons.\n      </p>\n      <img src={userflow2} />\n      <h1>Wireframes</h1>\n      <p>Wireframing is an important step because it allowed me to visualize how the features will look. The goal here was to create quick sketches to get the point across without spending too much time on the UI elements.</p>\n      <p>The biggest challenge I had when creating these sketches was making sure the interaction was clear. I made sure to use arrows and coloured dots to indicate click marks.</p>\n      <img src={wireframe} />\n      <p>The early prototypes of MILLA included a splash screen, welcome page and onboarding screens that highlighted some of the important features of the app. The user is then directed to a screen where they could choose to sign up if they had not used the app before or login if they already had an account. For first time users once they signed in they were prompted with 4 personalization questions, which adds in the engagement and relevancy of the content that is presented to the user.</p>\n      <p>The user is then brought to the list of lessons page, which is also the home screen. From here users can navigate to their profile, the explore page or the notes page. The profile page allows them to change their preferences and personalizations. The explore feature allows them to take picture of objects around them, see the translation and listen to the pronunciation of those objects. The notes feature allows the user to create and save free form notes. As for the lessons, they are based mostly around audio clips. Since users wanted more detailed explanations of grammar, the app allows for a grammar drop down when users are going through the material.</p>\n      <h1>Prototype</h1>\n      <p>From my low-fidelity wireframes, I created a mid-fidelity prototype in Marvel, so that I could have my usability testers interact with a working version of MILLA.</p>\n      <h1>Early Prototypes Iterations</h1>\n      <p>{\"At first the lessons would finish and go straight back to the lessons page. The abruptness of the change left users confused and feeling like the lesson was incomplete. Having added a success screen after the lesson, not only allowed for a smoother transition for the user but also allowed for some gamification aspects to be shown and a place to motivate the user, and help them embrace mistakes (they're going to happen!) with exciting images and congratulatory wording.\"}</p>\n      <p>Another big issue was updating the navigation. At first I just used text as I was showing a low-fidelity prototype to reduce feedback on design however, the text ended up being a problem as it was too small to read. I updated the navigation to have icons and all users were instantly able to understand those better.</p>\n      <img className=\"image-left\" src={iteration1} />\n      <img className=\"image-right\" src={iteration2} />\n      <h1>{\"Usability Test Plan & Script\"}</h1>\n      <p>To test the MILLA prototype I created a usability test plan that asked 4 users that were either currently expats or frequent travellers to complete the following 4 direct tasks.</p>\n      <p>Read the full <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UibnHX7BjybTPz-591oKU-_B0CfJTGu9/view?usp=sharing\">Usability Test Plan</a>(PDF) which includes scope, schedule, metrics, script, and participant notes.</p>\n      <h1>Usability Test Report</h1>\n      <p>{\"I created a usability test report using the Jakob Nielsen's rating scale:\"}</p>\n      <p>{\"0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all\"}</p>\n      <p>1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project.</p>\n      <p>2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority.</p>\n      <p>3 = Major usability problem: important to fix and should be given high priority.</p>\n      <p>4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix before product can be released.</p>\n      <img src={testreport} />\n      <h1>Design Iterations</h1>\n      <p>Using my usability testing report I made some iterations to my designs by taking the most severe issues and finding solutions to the problems.</p>\n      <p><b>Observation #1:</b></p>\n      <p>{\"Most users thought that onboarding looked interactive but it is actually images of what the features will look like.

'Canvas' became 'Make Connections' to clarify to the users what would happen in the space. To make it extra clear how to use this space I added description text to explain how to use this feature. To make the notes feature easier to use I included it in the lessons as this is the point when most users would want to make a note about something they have just learned. That way they don't have to try and remember it after their lesson or exit out of the lesson just to make a note. Of course they can always review their notes by going into the notes page.\"}</p>\n      <p><b>Value:</b></p>\n      <p>This re-design makes the feature easier for the user to access as well as making this feature more easily understood by the user.</p>\n      <Quote text=\"I don't think I would use the notes function.
